            <ul class="py-4">
                <li> &#10020 Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family
                    in the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of Tamil Nadu. His father,Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his
                    mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
                    between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and
                    one sister in his family.</li>
                <li> &#10020 His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties
                    and
                    large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka
                    who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading
                    groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                    pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.</li>
                <li> &#10020 In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking
                    student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
                    After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went
                    on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras,
                    from where he graduated in physics in 1954.He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering
                    in Madras Institute of Technology. </li>
                <li> &#10020 While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack
                    of
                    progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next
                    three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you
                    under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."He narrowly missed achieving his
                    dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were
                    available in the IAF. </li>

                <li> &#10020 After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the
                    Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS).</li>
                <li> &#10020 He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his
                    choice of
                    a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the
                    renowned space scientist</li>
                <li> &#10020 In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he
                    was the
                project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the
                    Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable
                    rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval
                    and expanded the programme to include more engineers</li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li> &#10020 Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                    presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi
                    Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007 </li>
                <li> &#10020 On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
                    expressed
                    that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and
                    the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.</li>
                <li> &#10020 Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media
                    reports
                    in April claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.After the
                    reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people supporting his candidature.
                    The BJP potentially backed his nomination[failed verification], saying that the party would lend
                    their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed him
                    for the 2012 presidential election.</li>
                <li> &#10020 A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their
                    support for Kalam.Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as
                    the solitary supporter.On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll.

                    Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he
